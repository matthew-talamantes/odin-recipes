    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>You don't need fancy inserts or special pans to make a sweet and satisfying baked dessert in an instant pot. This easy recipe lets you cook up a warm, spiced apple treat right in the bowl of the machine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>Pinch grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>6 Honeycrisp apples, peeled and cored, but left whole</li>
        <li>One 15.25 oz. box yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup skin-on sliced almonds</li>
        <li>Ice cream, for serving</li>
        <li>Caramel sauce, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and 1 1/2 cups water in a bowl and add to a 6-quart Instant Pot®. Add the apples to the pot. Follow the manufacturer's guide for locking the lid and set to pressure cook on low for 1 minute. </li>
        <li>After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Break each apple in half using a wooden spoon. Place the cake mix in a bowl and combine with the butter, eggs and 3 tablespoons of the liquid from the pot; the mixture will be thick. Pour it evenly over the apples in the pot. Sprinkle with the almonds. Lock the lid and set to pressure cook on low for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Allow to sit for 15 minutes. Spoon the cake into bowls and top with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
